	<h2><a name="sound of letters">I hear the characters hitting the terminal</a></h2>
	<p>
		Sometimes i'm coding during the night, and seeing the output of a
		new program print in the terminal.
	</p>

		<figcaption>
			A terminal full of characters
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		But it only happens when the terminal receives a big buffer, doesn't
		happen when there is a pager, or just a few lines.	
	</p>
	<p>
		So when these letters appear i hear a sound like an impact, if you ever
		played front mission 4 the sound is like the impact from some shotguns.
